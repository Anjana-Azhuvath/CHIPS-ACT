# CHIPS-ACT
## Overview
This repository contains the research and analysis on the CHIPS for America Act’s impact on the semiconductor industry. The study examines how financial incentives, such as grants and tax credits, influence stock performance, market trends, and firm-level outcomes.

## Research Objectives
Our study investigates:

The immediate stock price reaction to CHIPS Act grant announcements.
Differences in stock trends before and after receiving a grant.
The relative benefits of grants for smaller vs. larger semiconductor firms.
## Methodology
Data Collection: Stock prices of 11 CHIPS Act grant recipients were sourced from NASDAQ.
Event Study Analysis: We examined abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) around grant announcements.
## Statistical Tests:
Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity.
Shapiro-Wilk test for normality.
CAPM
T-tests for significance of stock price reactions.
## Key Findings
Mixed Stock Market Reactions: Some companies experienced a positive response, while others saw declines due to investor uncertainty.
Short-Term Volatility, Long-Term Stability: Initial stock price drops occurred upon announcement, but some firms showed sustained growth over time.
Smaller Firms Benefited More: Companies with a high incentive-to-market capitalization ratio had stronger positive abnormal returns.
## Visualizations
The repository includes key plots to illustrate findings:

Abnormal Returns of CHIPS Act Recipients – Stock performance around announcement dates.
Cumulative Abnormal Returns Over Time – Long-term market response.
Incentive-Size Ratio vs. CAR – Relationship between grant size and stock performance.
Stock Volatility Before vs. After Grant – Market reactions to CHIPS Act funding.
Market Capitalization vs. Impact – How firm size influenced the grant’s effect.
